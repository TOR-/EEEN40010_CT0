\problem

The plant is given in \cref{eq:p1 plant tf}.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:p1 plant tf}
\mathcal{H}\left(s\right) = \frac{s+3.6}{s^2+20s+64}
\end{equation}

The poles of this plant are $\left\{-16, -4\right\}$ and it has a zero at $-3.6$.

The DC gain of the plant is $0.05625$. This was found by evaluating \cref{eq:p1 plant tf} at $s=0$.

The steady-state value of the response to a unit step was calculated using the \texttt{residue} command in \matlab to get the partial fraction expansion of the product of the laplace transform of the unit step $\frac{1}{s}$ and the plant transfer function. The denominator corresponding to the pole at 0 is the steady-state value, $0.05625$, as this term appears in the time-domain representation of the plant transfer function as $0.05625\exp{-0\cdot t}$ and is therefore constant $\forall t$.

There is a potentially dominant pole at $-4$. This should result in a 2\% settling time of $\frac{4}{4}=\SI{1}{\second}$. 

There should be no overshoot if this is a first order system.

% Explain any discrepancies between the predicted and actual values of steady-state value, 2% settling time and the percentage overshoot. 

The predicted and observed steady state values are identical to the level of precision given in the plot. The 2\% settling time and the percentage overshoot values differ however. This is caused by the supposed dominant pole at -4 not being sufficiently dominant for the plant's response to well approximate that of a first order system. The step response in the time domain is given in \cref{eq:p1 step time}. This shows that the non-dominant pole at -16 is $7\times$ greater than the pole at -4; since this pole is four times more negative and has a greater magnitude than the supposed dominant pole, this will decrease the settling time. The dominant pole's diminished magnitude relative to the non-dominant pole will also cause overshoot to occur, as the time taken for the dominant pole to assert its dominance is increased.

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:p1 step time}
	h(t) = 0.0563 + 0.0083\exp{-4t} -0.0646\exp{-16t}
\end{equation}

As \cref{fig:p1 step} shows, the step response exhibits overshoot but no ringing.
